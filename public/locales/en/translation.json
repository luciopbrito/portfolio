                    "description": "Since 2020, I have worked as a full-stack developer. Initially, I worked as a freelancer for <strong>Business Intelligence</strong> and <strong>Agribusiness</strong> companies to focus on ASP.NET Core and JavaScript Frameworks (Angular and React). Currently, I`m a Mid-level .NET Developer Analyst at The São Paulo State Court of Auditors (TCESP).\n\nThough my real jobs started in 2020, my interest in technology began in 2019, while I was still part of Students` Onion at State School Érico Veríssimo. My goal is to provide technology knowledge through challenges and real projects to enhance their technical skills.\n\nI`m curious by nature, and in my free time, I apply my knowledge to personal projects. I pursue challenges that boost my career and motivate me to create software and robust solutions.",
